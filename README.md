# 📈 Nigeria Inflation Analysis (2003–2024)

This project explores the trends, causes, and predictions of inflation in Nigeria using a dataset spanning 21 years. It combines data analysis, economic interpretation, machine learning, and forecasting to answer key questions like:

- What causes inflation in Nigeria?
- What role does oil export play?
- How can we forecast oil prices and inflation?

> 🔍 This project is designed for both technical and non-technical audiences and emphasizes clear, simple explanations.



## 📊 Key Highlights

- ✅ Tracked monthly inflation rates from 2003 to 2024
- 📉 Identified strong CPI-inflation correlations (e.g., Food CPI: +0.84)
- 🔁 Granger causality test revealed **Crude Oil Export** as a **predictive trigger** of inflation
- 🤖 Built an XGBoost machine learning model to **predict crude oil prices** with 94% accuracy
- 📉 Predicted inflation could reach 40–45% by 2028 without intervention
- 🛠 Suggested **policy reforms** based on data findings
